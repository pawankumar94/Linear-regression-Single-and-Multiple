# Implimentation of Linear Regression for Univariate and Multivariate Data 
![Python 2.7.15](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-2.7.15-blue)
# Problem Statement for Univariate :
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.The chain already has trucks in various cities,the file ex1data1.txt consist of Population(Independant Variable) and the Profits(Dependant variable)
|   | Population in city 10,000s | Profit in $10,000s |
|:-:|:--------------------------:|:------------------:|
| 0 |           6.1101           |       17.5920      |
| 1 |           5.5277           |       9.1302       |
| 2 |           8.5186           |       13.6620      |

Now we have to use this data to determine which city to expand to next and build model to predict Profit given the population of any city.
