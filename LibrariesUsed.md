# Used Libraries for  the task

- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy 
- Sklearn

### Matplotlib :
```
pip install matplotlib
```
Matplotlib library is a comprehensive library for creating interactive visualizations in python, for our task :
- we used the same to visualize how our data looks and get a insight about our hypothesis in a interactive way.
- we used the library for Visualizing our final results and come up with optimized hyperparameters( learning rate , Number of epochs)

### Pandas
```
pip install pandas
```
- Pandas library was used for the purpose of data analysis by mapping our orignal data into dataframe dataStructures
- Pandas can read data from variety of formats such as CSV , text file(in our case), TSV , etc.
- Data filtering and seperation of attributes and target class , insertion and deletion of collumns can be easily performed on dataframes

### Numpy 
```
pip install numpy
```
- Numpy library provides smaller memory consumption and better runtime behavior 
- Powerful N dimensional array object which was used in Multi linear regression task to store the values 
  of Biases and weights and perform reshaping and transforming dataframe to array for mathematical derivations

### Sklearn 
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
- Sklearn library contains several tools for machine learning and statistical modeling , one of them we used for Scaling our   features to deal with the Skewness  in our data.
